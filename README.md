# Pairs-Trading
  Pairs trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that matches a long position with a short position in a pair of highly correlated instruments such as two stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), currencies, commodities or options. Pairs traders wait for weakness in the correlation and then go long the under-performer while simultaneously short selling the over-performer, closing the positions as the relationship returns to statistical norms.
