# Pairs-Trading
  Pairs traders wait for weakness in the correlation and then go long the under-performer while simultaneously short selling the over-performer, closing the positions as the relationship returns to statistical norms. Thus, here we try to club togather assetes that are uncorrelated so that we can save ourselves from heavy loss. The basic strategy is to create an efficient portfolio with risk management characteristics .
